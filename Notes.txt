	- why we using bower in MEAN Stack project
	
to downlaod client-side dependencies (packages) [like: JQuery and AngularJs]

	- why we create .bowerrc file in MEAN Stack project 

to set configuration for bower , we set into file path directory which store bower_components [ this will change defualt behavior to store bower_components into folder named bower_components in root folder of mean poject]
Note : .bowerrc file like package.json and bower.json files , jest create {} object  	

	- Thirdy party middleware in Express 4.x

Express 4.x in no longer depends on connect unlike Express 3.x 
So all built-in middleware in connect which used in Express too Now must install them as dependency (module)
Except express.static , we can use it as built-in middleware [ express.static also has it own middleware called serve-static ]

Ex: 
	In Express 3.x we use express.logger() to log infomation about node server in Terminal
	Now in Express 4.x logger called mongan middleware 

	In code must Replace -> 

		var express = require('express');
		var app = express();
			app.use(express.logger('div'));    	

	With ->		
		var express = require('express')
			morgan	= require('morgan');
		var app = express();
			app.use(morgan('div'));
